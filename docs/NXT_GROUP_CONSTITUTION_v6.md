# NXT Group – Master Build & Structure (v6)

## Core Principle
First focus = Print Studio (Venue 1). All structures (board, workflows, infra) must scale across all 6 venues. **Speed > Perfection** — skeleton crew first, refine later.

## Board of Directors (Senior Management AIs)
**Phase 1 (Launch — non-negotiable):**
- **Assistant (Ops):** orchestration, queues, wiring  
- **Doctor (QA):** testing, regression, fail detection  
- **Butler (Experience):** approvals, reports, user flow  
- **Finance (Treasury):** ROI, cost caps, capital allocation  
- **Security (Compliance):** secrets, audits, ports, legal safety  
_(Factory can't launch live without these five online.)_

**Phase 2 (Growth):** Marketing Director → exposure, CTR, channel optimisation  
**Phase 3 (Evolution):** Strategy Director → scouting, new venues; R&D Director → sandbox/experiments/new tech; Educator → self-learning core & training

## Governance
- **Golden Rule (Owner Veto):** Owner approval required for major spend, venue launches, or constitution changes.  
- **Auditability:** Proposal → Approval → Execution always logged.  
- **Dual Knowledge:** Directors balance internal ops + external market awareness.

## Venues (HQ → 6 Businesses)
- **NXT Print Studio** (digital → physical)  
- **Branding Platform** (SaaS design/brand kits)  
- **Nexframe** (YouTube/Shorts engine)  
- **AI F&B Consultant** (hospitality advisory)  
- **AI Trading System** (compounding growth)  
- **LuxScout** (luxury assets + collateral loops)  
Each runs independently with a venue manager, reporting to HQ.

## Workflow & Tools
- **Dev Flow:** Blueprint (Owner+Architect) → Windsurf (speed/modules) → Cursor (backbone/integration/contracts/CI/security)  
- **CI/CD Gates:** secret scans, cost caps, unit/integration/E2E tests. Promotion gates: no unsafe merges. Owner Veto required before live.

## Hardware Phasing
Phase 1: Mac Studio + NVMe + cloud APIs → Phase 2: single 4090 box → Phase 3: 3–4 node cluster → Phase 4: multi-site replication.

## Build Order
Phase 1: Launch 5 core Directors → Print Studio  
Phase 2: Add Marketing → stabilise growth  
Phase 3: Add Strategy, R&D, Educator → scale  
Phase 4: Expand to Branding → multi-venue synergy
